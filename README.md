GitHub Repository Description: Expense Tracker by Himanshu Singh

👋 Hello, fellow developers! I'm Himanshu Singh, a first-year B.E. C.S.E. student, passionate about honing my skils. This project, an Expense Tracking website, serves as a playground for me to implement a variety of functions and tags learned in my introductory courses.

Project Highlights:

🚀 Functional Variety: This project focuses on incorporating a myriad of functions and tags, showcasing the versatility of these technologies. Expect to find a range of features inspired by JavaScript concepts taught in class.
📝 To-Do List Integration: Witness the integration of a to-do list, demonstrating my understanding of dynamic content manipulation using JavaScript so far.
🔗 Bootstrap Elements: Explore the utilization of Bootstrap to enhance the project's responsiveness and layout structure. Himanshu aims to emphasize functionality over aesthetic appeal at this stage of his learning journey.
🌐 HTML Mastery: Dive into the HTML codebase, where Himanshu employs various tags to structure and organize the website's content.
Project Structure:

📂 /src: Contains the source code files for the project.
📁 /js: Houses JavaScript files implementing various functions.
📁 /css: Includes Bootstrap and custom CSS files for styling.
📁 /html: Holds HTML files with tags showcasing the student's understanding of HTML concepts.

Contributions and Feedback:
👍 Contributions and constructive feedback are highly encouraged! Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, and help me on my journey to becoming proficient with web developiing.


Note: While the project may prioritize the implementation of functions and tags, certain features, like the to-do list, are expected to function properly. Keep in mind that this project is primarily a learning endeavor, focusing on the utilization of various technologies rather than achieving a polished and fully functional expense tracker.
