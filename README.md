Project Highlights:
<br>

🚀 Functional Variety: This project focuses on incorporating a myriad of functions and tags, showcasing the versatility of these technologies. Expect to find a range of features inspired by JavaScript concepts taught in class.
📝 To-Do List Integration: Witness the integration of a to-do list, demonstrating my understanding of dynamic content manipulation using JavaScript so far.
🔗 Bootstrap Elements: Explore the utilization of Bootstrap to enhance the project's responsiveness and layout structure. I aim to emphasize functionality over aesthetic appeal at this stage of my learning journey!.
🌐 HTML Mastery: Dive into the HTML codebase, where employed are various tags to structure and organize the website's content.
Project Structure:

📁 /js: Houses JavaScript files implementing various functions.
<br>
📁 /css: Includes Bootstrap and custom CSS files for styling.
<br>
📁 /html: Holds HTML files with tags showcasing the student's understanding of HTML concepts.

Contributions and Feedback:
👍 Contributions and constructive feedback are highly encouraged! Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, and help me on my journey to becoming proficient with web developiing.


Note: While the project may prioritize the implementation of functions and tags, certain features, like the to-do list, are expected to function properly. Keep in mind that this project is primarily a learning endeavor, focusing on the utilization of various functions rather than achieving a polished and fully functional expense tracker.
